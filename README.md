### Dear reader

**As a job:** I work with **Android** (Kotlin + Jetpack Compose). I also have a professional experience in **Frontend**.

**As a hobby:** I develop small video games, mainly in **C#** (Godot, Unity).

One day I'll create my own prototype of a video game engine, but for now, I'd like to keep my hairline from receding.  
  
  
*My body is a machine that turns key-strokes into somewhat readable code.*
